This is a self-paced online workshop where you will get hands-on experience with
GitOps and Progressive Delivery using Amazon EKS, eksctl, AWS App Mesh, Flux and Flagger. 

### Challenge

* Your own laptop and an internet connection
* Fill out this form [http://bit.ly/gitops-handson-form](http://bit.ly/gitops-handson-form)
* You own an AWS account (this costs about $1-2 to complete and about $7/week if you keep the cluster)
* Follow the self-paced workshop instructions (you can stop right before the canary rollback step)

If we can come to your city, we will bring you this T-shirt. (So don't forget to fill out the form!)
